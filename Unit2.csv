Term,Definition
Computer,"A machine that accepts input data, processes it via stored instructions, and outputs information."
Program (source code),Step-by-step instructions written in a language a computer can understand.
Object code,Binary (0s/1s) translation of source code that the computer executes.
Central processing unit (CPU),The 'heart' of a computer that executes instructions.
Arithmetic logic unit (ALU),Performs arithmetic and comparison (relational) operations.
Control unit,Directs operations of the computer (tells the computer what to do).
Main (primary) memory,Stores data and instructions needed by the CPU.
Single processor,One CPU in a single computer.
Multiprocessor,Two or more CPUs in one computer.
